## Configuration

pez uses two main configuration files: `pez.toml` and `pez-lock.toml.` By default, these files are created in the fish configuration directory, but you can specify a different location using environment variables.

Configuration File Locations

The configuration files are located based on the following priority: `$PEZ_CONFIG_DIR` > `$__fish_config_dir` > `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fish` > `~/.config/fish`

### pez.toml

`pez.toml` is the primary configuration file where you define the plugins you want to manage. Below is an example structure:

```toml
[[plugins]]
repo = "owner/repo" # The plugin repository in the format <owner>/<repo>

# Add additional plugins by copying the [[plugins]] block.
```

### pez-lock.toml

`pez-lock.toml` is automatically generated and maintained by pez. It records detailed information about the installed plugins, including their source repositories and specific commit SHAs. Do not edit this file manually.

## Data Directory

pez clones plugin repositories into a designated data directory, prioritized as follows: `$PEZ_DATA_DIR` > `$__fish_user_data_dir/pez` > `$XDG_DATA_HOME/fish/pez` > `~/.local/share/fish/pez`

When you install a plugin, pez clones its repository into pez_data_dir. If the directory doesnâ€™t exist, pez will create it. If the repository is already cloned, pez will notify you and skip cloning unless you use the --force option to re-clone it.

After cloning, if the repository contains functions, completions, conf.d, or themes directories, pez will copy the files from these directories to the corresponding fish configuration directories:

- `~/.config/fish/functions`
- `~/.config/fish/completions`
- `~/.config/fish/conf.d`
- `~/.config/fish/themes`

If a file with the same name already exists in the destination, pez will overwrite it.

The destination fish configuration directory can be overridden using the following environment variables: `$__fish_config_dir` > `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fish` > `~/.config/fish`

Additionally, `pez-lock.toml` records information about the installed packages and the files copied. It is created in the same directory as `pez.toml` and will append information if it already exists.
