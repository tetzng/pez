A Rust-based plugin manager for [fish](https://fishshell.com/)

## Installation

Ensure you have Rust installed on your system. You can install pez using Cargo:

```sh
# From crates.io (if available)
cargo install pez

# From source (in this repo)
cargo install --path .
```

## Quick Start

```fish
# 1) Initialize configuration (creates pez.toml)
pez init

# 2) Add a plugin to pez.toml (choose one of repo/url/path)
#    [[plugins]]
#    repo = "owner/repo"      # GitHub shorthand
#    # version = "v3"        # Or: tag = "...", branch = "...", commit = "..."
#
#    # [[plugins]]
#    # url = "https://gitlab.com/owner/repo"  # Any Git host URL
#    # branch = "main"
#
#    # [[plugins]]
#    # path = "~/path/to/local/plugin"       # Local directory (absolute or ~/ only)
#    # Note: when specifying a relative path at the CLI (e.g., ./plugin), pez normalizes it to an absolute path in pez.toml.

# 3) Install plugins listed in pez.toml
pez install

# 4) Verify installation
pez list --format table

# 5) (Optional) Enable completions for pez itself
pez completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/pez.fish
```

## Shell Completions

```fish
pez completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/pez.fish
```

```

### init

```fish
# Initialize pez
pez init
```

### install

```fish
# Install plugins listed in pez.toml.
pez install

# Force reinstalling plugins even if they are already installed
pez install --force

# Remove plugins present in pez-lock.toml but not in pez.toml
pez install --prune

# Install a specific plugin
pez install owner/package1

# Install multiple plugins at once
pez install owner/package1 owner/package2
```

### uninstall

```fish
# Uninstall a single plugin
pez uninstall owner/package1

# Uninstall multiple plugins
pez uninstall owner/package1 owner/package2

# Remove orphaned files even if repo dir is missing
pez uninstall --force owner/package1
```

### upgrade

```fish
# Upgrade all installed plugins
pez upgrade

# Upgrade a specific plugin
pez upgrade owner/package1

# Upgrade multiple plugins at once
pez upgrade owner/package1 owner/package2
```

### list

```fish
# List all installed plugins
pez list

# List only outdated plugins
pez list --outdated

# Output format: plain (default), table, json
pez list --format table
pez list --outdated --format json

# Filter by regex (matches name/repo/source)
pez list --filter 'tide|fzf'
 
# Note: table/json output includes a `selector` column derived from pez.toml
# (version:/branch:/tag:/commit:/latest or local/pinned).
```

### prune

```fish
# Prune uninstalled plugins
pez prune

# Dry run to see what would be pruned
pez prune --dry-run

# Skip confirmation when pez.toml is empty
pez prune --yes
```

### doctor

```fish
# Run diagnostics (checks config, lockfile, data dir, target files)
pez doctor

# JSON output
pez doctor --format json
```

### migrate (from fisher)

```fish
# Reads fish_plugins and updates pez.toml
pez migrate

# Write changes and immediately install migrated plugins
pez migrate --install

# Preview changes without writing files
pez migrate --dry-run

# Overwrite existing pez.toml plugin list instead of merging
pez migrate --force
```

## Configuration

pez uses two main configuration files: `pez.toml` and `pez-lock.toml.`
By default, these files are created in the fish configuration directory,
but you can specify a different location using environment variables.

Configuration File Locations

The configuration files are located based on the following priority:
`$PEZ_CONFIG_DIR` > `$__fish_config_dir` > `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fish` > `~/.config/fish`

### pez.toml (Schema)

`pez.toml` is the primary configuration file where you define the plugins
you want to manage. Below is an example structure:

```toml
# GitHub shorthand
[[plugins]]
repo = "owner/repo"
# version = "latest"   # default if omitted
# version = "v3"       # branch or tag name; branches preferred over tags
# branch  = "develop"
# tag     = "v1.0.0"
# commit  = "<sha>"    # 7+ chars recommended (unique per repo)

# Generic Git host URL
[[plugins]]
url = "https://gitlab.com/owner/repo"
# branch = "main"

# Local path (absolute or ~/ only)
[[plugins]]
path = "~/path/to/local/plugin"
```

### pez-lock.toml

`pez-lock.toml` is automatically generated and maintained by pez.
It records detailed information about the installed plugins,
including their source repositories and specific commit SHAs.
Do not edit this file manually.

### Custom Target Directory

By default, pez copies files into your Fish config directory. To override the
destination, set `PEZ_TARGET_DIR` to a custom base directory. For example:

```sh
export PEZ_TARGET_DIR="$HOME/.local/share/my-fish"
```

Themes are discovered by `fish_config` under `$__fish_config_dir/themes`. If you
customize `PEZ_TARGET_DIR`, consider symlinking the `themes` directory into your
Fish config dir so themes appear in `fish_config`.

## Data Directory

pez clones plugin repositories into a designated data directory,
prioritized as follows:
`$PEZ_DATA_DIR` > `$__fish_user_data_dir/pez` > `$XDG_DATA_HOME/fish/pez` > `~/.local/share/fish/pez`

When you install a plugin, pez clones its repository into `pez_data_dir`.
If the directory doesnâ€™t exist, pez will create it.
If the repository is already cloned, pez will notify you and skip cloning
unless you use the --force option to re-clone it.

After cloning, if the repository contains functions, completions, conf.d,
or themes directories, pez will recursively copy files from these directories
to the corresponding fish configuration directories:

- `~/.config/fish/functions`
- `~/.config/fish/completions`
- `~/.config/fish/conf.d`
- `~/.config/fish/themes`

If a file with the same name already exists in the destination,
pez will overwrite it.

The destination fish configuration directory can be overridden
using the following environment variables:
`$__fish_config_dir` > `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fish` > `~/.config/fish`

Additionally, `pez-lock.toml` records information about the installed packages
and the files copied. It is created in the same directory as `pez.toml`
and will append information if it already exists.

### Concurrency

Control job parallelism for installs/uninstalls with `PEZ_JOBS` (default: 4).
